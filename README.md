# QA Testing Quiz

## About
The necessary testing has been implemented in the prototype login portal developed by MeldCX for the QA Code Challenge.

## Recommended Software
The prototype was compiled using Node.js v16.20.2.
For compatibility, users are recommended to use the same version or any release within the Node.js 16.x series.

If you use different version of Node.js, you can use NVM(Node Version Manager) to use multiple verions of Node.js.

- Download NVM from https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases
- Uninstall existing Node.js from your machine
- Install NVM
- After installing NVM you can check the current version by running the following command on command prompt
```
nvm -v

```
- Install Node.js using NVM
```
nvm install 16

```
- You can install multiple version of Node.js using NVM
```
nvm install 22

```
- Choose between different versions
```
nvm use 16

```
or

```
nvm use 22

```
- Check the current version of Node running in your machine by
```
node -v

```

Use recommended version of Node.js before setting up the prototype

## Installation and dependencies
